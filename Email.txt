Hey Team - 
First off, I hope everyone is staying safe and enjoying their weekend.My Dad runs Pastoral Care at Bronson Hospital; back home in Kalamazoo and tested positive this weekend. 
Unfortunately, my flights were rebooked to Monday.
Truly apologize for this unexpected inconvenience; indubitably, once I have reached, I will logonand closeout whatever needs to be completed. 
Incontestably, I will be online for the rest of the week.
@Raj & Charlie: I would be more than happy to help with the nightly deployments if you think that might be helpful.  You guys spend copious amounts of hours with it; at the end of the day we succeed & fail as a team, so if there is anyone to share that knowledge & responsibility, please do let me know.
