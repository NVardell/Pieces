/**
 * List Directory Size & Files using Stacks
 *
 * Write a program that takes the name of a directory as an input, and
 * prints out all of the files contained in this directory and any
 * subdirectories. Also prints out the file size (in bytes) of each file.
 *
 * Repeat using recursion and name your program DirectoryR.java.
 * Modify DirectoryR.java so that it prints out each subdirectory and its
 * total size. The size of a directory is equal to the sum of all of the
 * files it contains or that its subdirectories contain.
